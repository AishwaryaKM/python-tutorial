Changelog
=========

HEAD

 - Operator precedence is now taken into account such that we can
   avoid unnecessary use of parentheses. This is done not only for
   aesthetic reasons, but more importantly to avoid running into
   parser errors due to Python's nesting limitation. [malthe]

0.5 (released 28/11/2008)

 - Added `yield` and unary operators. [malthe]

0.4 (released 28/11/2008)

 - Make sure all binary operators get parentheses around them; we may
   be able to improve upon this in the future (for
   legibility-reasons). [malthe]

0.3 (released 27/11/2008)

 - Added logical operators. [malthe]

 - Fixed tuple unpacking issues. [malthe]

 - Added for-loop. [malthe]

0.2 (released 27/11/2008)

 - Fixed issue with tuples and parentheses. [malthe]

 - Fixed issue with multiple assignments. [malthe]

 - Added support for `not` operator. [malthe]

 - Fixed issue where default arguments would be written incorrectly if
   no non-keyword arguments were present. [malthe]

 - Fixed issue where statements would not be cleared properly. [malthe]

 - Assignments are statements and should terminate. [malthe]

0.1 (released 26/11/2008)
