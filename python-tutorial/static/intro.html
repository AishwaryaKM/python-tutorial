  <h1>Online Python Tutorial</h1>
  <p>This is an <em>experimental</em> project aiming to provide an
    interactive python interpreter to casual web visitors so that
    they can familiarise themselves with the python programming
    language.  It is not ready for general use so I recommend
    visiting the
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html">officlal
      python tutorial</a> instead, for now.  The source code for
    the project can be found on
    <a href="http://github.com/jwal/python-tutorial">github.com</a>.</p>
  <p>The Online Python Tutorial is hosted
    on <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App
      Engine</a> [GAE] which provides free python web hosting on the
    google infrastructure.  Users of this site can submit python
    code from their browser to run on the google servers.  The
    submitted code runs in a restricted execution environment to
    protect the application and to protect users from each other.
    At the moment submitted code must conform to the rules imposed
    by
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/cappython">CapPython</a> but
    this restriction may be relaxed in the future.  No standard
    library modules are available.  CapPython is written in pure
    python but relies on the built-in python <code>parser</code>
    module which is not available under GAE.  To work around this
    the Online Python Tutorial uses a mostly complete Python 2.5
    parser in pure-python taken from
    the <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/">PyPy</a> project.</p>
  <p>The tutorial walks you through writing your first python program
     in stages.  Use the arrows at the top of this box to move to the
     next part.</p>
