  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>The box below provides an area where you can write python code.
     You can then execute the python code using
     the <strong>Execute</strong> button below it.  The output from
     the python program you wrote will be displayed above it.</p>
  <p>An example program is provided which you can load using
     the <strong>Fill in example</strong> button.  Don't worry about
     understanding the program at this stage, just execute it for
     now.</p>
  <p>As you can see the python program has generated the optimistic
     message <em>hello, world</em> and it has printed the first ten
     numbers of
     the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
     number sequence</a>.</p>
  <p>To learn python it is important to write python code.  This
     tutorial will show you plenty of code snippets but please do type
     them out yourself to train your fingers.</p>
  <p>Next we will start a simpler program ourselves.</p>
