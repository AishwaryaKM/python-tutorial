  <p>Hopefully I will continue writing this tutorial at some point.
     Ideally the tutorial will progress fairly rapidly to the point of
     deploying a simple web application for public viewing instead of
     focussing on boring syntax and helper libraries.  That will take
     some development work so I might leave the textual part of the
     tutorial to go stale for a while.</p>
