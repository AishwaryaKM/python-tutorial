  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>"<em>Hello, world!</em>" is the first program that most people
     write when learning a new programming language.  Some languages
     make it quite difficult but python get's straight to the point.
     The keyword <code>print</code> is used to produce output so the
     program is simply:</p>
<pre>
print "Hello, world"
</pre>
  <p>The quotation marks tell python that there is text to print but
     it is equally easy to print numbers, for example:</p>
<pre>
print 1, 2, 1 + 2
</pre>
  <p>You can build up python programs by issuing several statements in
     sequence.  When using this tutorial, I'd suggest continuing the
     program you are working on until either the input or output
     becomes cumbersome.  Then delete everything and proceed with a
     clean slate.</p>
