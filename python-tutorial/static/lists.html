  <h1>Lists</h1>
  <p>As well as individual items, python has a simple syntax for
     collecting items together into lists.</p>
  <p>First, make a list</p>
<pre>
a_list = [1, 2, "three"]
</pre>
  <p>Then print the list and it's length</p>
<pre>
print "A list with", len(a_list), "items is:", a_list
</pre>
  <p>In addition to lists, this program introduces other new concepts.
     The name <code>a_list</code> is used as an alias to refer to the
     three items collectively.  This saves us from having to type it
     out in both of the places we use it.</p>
  <p>The construction <code>len(a_list)</code> is used to fetch the
     size of the list.  This might be useful if we added something to
     the list later.</p>
<pre>
a_list.append(4)
print len(a_list), a_list[0], a_list[1], a_list[-1]
</pre>
  <p><code>append</code> modifies the collection by adding a new item
     to the end.  The square brackets are a convenient way to fetch
     individual items from the list.  The first item is given the
     number 0 and you can use negative numbers to get items positioned
     relative to the end of the list.</p>
