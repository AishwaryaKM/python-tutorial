PyPy 1.1: Compatibility & Consolidation
==========================================

Welcome to the PyPy 1.1 release - the first release after the end of EU
funding. This release focuses on making PyPy's Python interpreter more
compatible with CPython (currently CPython 2.5).

PyPy's Getting Started lives at:

Highlights of This Release
==========================

  - More of CPython's standard library extension modules are supported,
    among them ctypes, sqlite3, csv, and many more. Most of these modules 
    extension are fully supported under Windows as well.

  - performance improvements: between 0.8-2x (and in some corner case 3-4x)
    the time spent by CPython XXX we should measure 1.0 and compare
  - new garbage collectors: moving GCs, e.g. generational, hybrid, etc., threads+gc work

  - Our Python interpreter now supports distutils as well as
    easy_install for pure-Python modules.

  - We have tested PyPy with a number of third-party libraries. PyPy can
    run now: Django, Pylons, BitTorrent, Twisted, SymPy, Pyglet, Nevow,
    Pinax:

  - A buildbot was set up to run the various tests that PyPy is using
    nightly on Windows and Linux machines:

  - Sandboxing support: It is possible to translate the Python
    interpreter in a special way so that the result is fully sandboxed.

Other Changes
=============

  - memory wise optimizations (check it): mark-compact GC, shared instance
    dictionaries also for instances of old-style classes; user class instances
    often 50% of CPython size!

  - The ``clr`` module was greatly improved. This module is used to
    interface with .NET libraries when translating the Python
    interpreter to the CLI.

  - Stackless improvements: PyPy's ``stackless`` module is now more
    complete. We added channel preferences which change details of the
    scheduling semantics. In addition, the pickling of tasklets has been
    improved to work in more cases.

  - Classic classes are enabled by default now. In addition, they have
    been greatly optimized and debugged:

  - PyPy's Python interpreter can be translated to Java bytecode now to
    produce a pypy-jvm. At the moment there is no integration with
    Java libraries, so this is not really useful yet.

  - We added cross-compilation machinery to our translation toolchain to
    make it possible to cross-compile our Python interpreter to Nokia's
    Maemo platform:

  - The support for the trace hook in the Python interpreter was
    improved to be able to trace the execution of builtin functions and
    methods. With this, we implemented the ``_lsprof`` module, which is
    the core of the ``cProfile`` module.

  - A number of rarely used features of PyPy were removed since the previous
    release because they were unmaintained and/or buggy. Those are: The
    LLVM and the JS backends, the aspect-oriented programming features,
    the logic object space, the extension compiler and the first
    incarnation of the JIT generator. The new JIT generator is in active
    development, but not included in the release.
